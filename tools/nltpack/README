This tool packs / unpacks the game archive files of the Nordlandtrilogie /
Realms of Arkania series. This includes:
- Part 1: SCHICK.DAT/BLADE.DAT
- Part 2: All .DAT files with matching .FN files
- Part 3: All .ALF files.

Usage:
NLTpack v0.3a (C) 2008,2009 by Hendrik Radke
usage: nltpack <Mode> <File> [-p FilePattern]\n";
Modes:
x: extract all files from the archive matching the pattern.
l: list all files from the archive matching the pattern.
c: create an archive with all matching files. [1]
u: update/add matching files to archive (not yet working).
m: create Master file (.FN) for the archive.

[1] Special care has to be taken that all needed files are present for
SCHICK.DAT/BLADE.DAT. Also, you *must* provide a matching .FN file
(see below) if you want to create an archive.

On .FN files:
Since some of the archive formats, notably the archives for the second
part of the NLT (Sternenschweif / Star Trail), may contain "dummy" files,
a special ".FN" file is needed in addition to the .DAT file.
To generate a .FN file for an archive, use the "m" mode:
./nltpack m /path/to/archive.dat
which generates a file
/path/to/archive.fn
Afterwards you can create the archive with
cd /path/to/uncompressed/files
./nltpack c /path/to/archive.dat *
