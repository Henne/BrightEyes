# CD-Audio Music

## General 
In this directory reside the audio files for (maybe in the neae future added games).
The naming convention comes from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org).
To avoid copyright infringements, you are encouraged to rip the audio tracks from your original storage devices yourself.

A recommended program is [Sound Juicer](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/SoundJuicer).

The only recommended file format is FLAC, since quality is very important.
To avoid spelling mistakes and the hassle of naming files we recommend the tagger [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org).


## If you wanna do this by yourself

... take a look at the README.md in the subdirectory.
