# CD-Audio Music

## General 
In this directory reside the audio files for (maybe in the neae future added games).
The naming convention comes from [![MusicBrainz](https://static.metabrainz.org/MB/header-logo-1f7dc2a.svg)](https://musicbrainz.org).
To avoid copyright infringements, you are encouraged to rip the audio tracks from your original storage devices yourself.
A recommended program is Sound-Juicer.
The only recommended file format is FLAC, since quality is important.
To avoid spelling mistakes and the hassle of naming files we recommend the tagger Picard.
