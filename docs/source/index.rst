======================================

computer games from the MS-DOS-era which are considered worthy of protection by the author of BrightEyes*.
The project was initiated in the year 2010 and can be considered as **digital monument protection**.
The game which started the project is called "Das schwarze Auge: Die Schicksalsklinge" also known as
